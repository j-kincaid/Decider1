### CONCEPT:

An app providing a rubric to assist nonprofit arts organizations in selecting artistic and cultural exhibitions and performances in competitive calls for entry. The goal of this app is to aid curators and their teams to ensure equitable selection processes.

### FEATURES:

- Administrator account creation
- Panelist account creation
- Logins with validation
- Admin(s) complete fields for applicants, selection criteria, scoring, comments, etc., as much data as they need
- Panelists can create, read, update, and delete their own entries until the "deadline".
- Admin can create a report displaying scoring and any fields as desired.

### GOALS: 

- Consolidation of data for submissions received enables creation of reports
- Objective collection of votes and comments limits biases in decision making of panelists
